      <p>
        My name is Fortune Christopher Bako. I am a citizen of Nigeria, born in
        Abuja. I received my primary school leaving certificate from a
        government school called Nyanya Bagyi in Nasarawa State, Karu Local
        Government. I am currently seventeen (17) years old.
      </p>
      <h2>Reason Why I Joined AltSchool Africa</h2>
      <p>
        I joined AltSchool Africa to build on my tech and programming skills.
        AltSchool Africa has a proven record of training and guiding students to
        become tech ambassadors worldwide. This proven record, along with the
        supportive learning environment and student circles, made it the best
        place for me to learn. That is the main reason I chose AltSchool Africa.
